For the entities, \nthese powers are exceptionally easy to put together and do provide some minute \namounts of data - the creation of blasters helps to ramp up overall conflict, collect this \nsmall amount of data, and refine the most effective weapons that the entities/their \navatars can use to defend themselves. \n \nBlaster triggers involve a type, essentially the ‘gun’ that the blaster fires, and the \nelement, which determines the damage type and special effects of whatever bullet is \nproduced. \n \nType - Element - Secondary Blasters - Blaster Bonuses \nBlaster Generation - Example Blasts \nBlaster Types \n \nWhen figuring out the framework of the trigger and how it applies to the power, take \nnote of the two categories below that stand out the most, and combine them.  The detail \nsheet has suggested powers for cross-interactions. \n \nDamage blasters arise from scenarios where the sense of physical danger is especially \npoignant - many from cases where the trigger sees multiple individuals dying around the \ncape.  Damage blasters emphasize raw offensive power, with attacks that deliver \nmultiple wounds per hit and/or penetrate armor. \n●​ Machine gun ‘spray’ with some armor penetration. \n●​ Boomerang cleaves through whole groups."

While all powers have some small element of breaker to \nthem, the breaker-centric powers are the ones where the individual switches over to a \ncompletely different state.  The state can have a singular benefit that breaks the defined \nrules of reality (as any power does, but centered around the parahuman’s capabilities) \nor a state they enter that contains a suite of powers, but which may have costs to enter, \nmaintain, or costs and complications in other forms. \n \nBreaker triggers are perhaps the hardest to define lay out in clear terms.  Breakers \nsometimes come from abstract stressors or those things that are the very odd fits for \nother classifications.  For a mover, this might include things like wanting to escape on a \nphysical level while mentally feeling that the situation is safe, the inverse, or something \nmore abstract, like wanting to escape reality on a spiritual level and finding oneself \nunable, or wanting to escape a concept or wanting to escape something that cannot be \navoided on a fundamental level.  Other Breakers arise from cases where the lines are \nso blurred and/or intermingled between the physical and the mental that usual \nclassifications don’t neatly fit.  Drugs, poisons, medical conditions and mental illness \nvery frequently create the unusual scenarios that make Breaker triggers possible. \n \nThe trick, and where things get hard to discern, is that it can be hard to say if the trigger \nis a breaker trigger that has (as an example) Striker and Changer interlinked in one \nelement, or if A and B are simply separate factors of the same trigger.  The former might \nlead to a breaker with elements of Striker and Changer, while the latter might lead to a \ncape with a Striker primary power and a Changer secondary, or vice versa.  With this in \nmind, key questions to ask are: \n●​ Could the elements feeding into one aspect of the trigger be removed, with the \ntrigger event still making some degree of sense?

If so, that might create the conditional factor that makes it more ‘Breaker’. \n●​ Does, for lack of a better way of putting it, the trigger sit on the outside bounds of \nthe usual ‘box’ that the classification fits in?  Strikers trigger from in-your-face \nhostile threats.  Is the threat hard to define or explain, either in the character’s \nperceptions or in reality?  Changers trigger from identity issues and cases where \nthe outside world impugns the character’s set identity.  Is that identity hard to \ndefine or explain, even for the character?  Similar questions can be asked for \nother classifications.  Is the damage a Brute takes hard to explain or frame?

In \ngame terms, this is a shift away from standard mechanics. \n \nTo compare: a changer might grow praying mantis arms, but they would still lean heavily \non standard game mechanics, with attack rolls, wounds, normal movement and the like.   \nThey might take a round or two to actually alter their arms into these giant scythes, and"

Items picked up after breaking might be \nhard to wield, damaged by the breaker pattern, or only be able to be used for a short \ntime before problems arise. \n \nCostume may still be important to a limited degree, as breaker powers that override \nequipment often take on traits from the costume or use the costume to inspire the \nbreaker form (something we see in the ‘ghosts’ that Glaistig Uaine summons).  A mask \nwith horns might lead to a breaker form where the head looks like a skull with horns that \nburns with blue fire.  When costume traits are overridden, some breaker forms may take \narmor traits that are deleterious in normal form on as beneficial ones; wearing a \ncostume with armor heavy enough it impedes movement might be an inconvenience in \nnormal form, but in the breaker form it becomes a part of the form, with some natural \narmor.  This generally requires doubling down on the same element (armor, flowing \ncape, etc), adding a detriment, with only half of that doubled-down costume element \ncarrying over.

          "text": "Muscle Brutes \n \nMuscle brutes are those who rely on size, physical strength, and some tenacity for their \nbrute disposition.  Biokinesis is often a factor, or their power might run through their \nbodies and have a sort of changer effect on them, with veins of fire and surging size and \nproportion.  Where brutes fall somewhere on a sliding scale of raw strength and raw \ntoughness, the Muscle brute fall rather heavily on the ‘raw strength’ end of the sliding \nscale. In execution, they tend to gain a lot of raw stats.  Examples might include: ​\n \n●​ The Ogre brute, who adds a few hundred pounds of raw muscle and a couple of \nfeet of height to their stature.  Mutations, if any, are minor.   \n●​ The Dragonscale brute, who gains size, strength, and a covering of armor scales, \nwith more emphasis on natural weapons.  Not necessarily dragon-themed. \n●​ The Hammer brute, who modifies hands and arms to block incoming attacks (that \nshe or he is aware of) and deliver incredibly powerful slams.  The nature and \nshape of the hands may vary. \n●​ The Thick Skin brute, who has an organic layer (skin, wood, callous, tumor, shell) \nthat blocks incoming damage.  As the layer is broken away, they gain added \npowers or raw strength, which diminishes as the layer is replaced. \n \nMuscle brutes arise from scenarios where the damage done is to one body part, where \nthis is meaningful enough to register to the victim, and where the source of the damage \nis physical and solid.  A man takes an arrow to the vitals when he is poaching on \nparkland and strays into the path of another poacher.  A woman has her eyes torn out of \nher skull by her fundamentalist religious husband.  A child has her hands destroyed with \na ball-peen hammer for daring to strike back against her golden child brother. \n \nIn some cases, the Muscle brute arises from an instance of a struggle, or a struggle is \ncompounded by the damage to the one body part.  The struggle part of the trigger feeds \ninto the offensive (and Striker-ish) lean of the Muscle brute.  Non-brute triggers that \nhave the struggle might have the strain or frustration of the body tapping into the brute \nexecutions of the shard.  The ‘I’m not strong enough’ damage to self-image affects the \nchanger element in execution.  The shard may well draw inspiration from the struggle in \nrelating back to the power, or draw cues from the frustrated self-image to mess with the \ntrigger recipient.  Failing this, it’s liable to make the triggeree ugly or horrifying. \n \nExamples of secondary or minor Muscle powers include limited biokinesis, and surges \nof strength and power that become more intense with injury."

The armor often regenerates and/or provides additional capabilities.  \nHeavily defense-leaning, but often provided with a weapon of some sort, raw stats, or \ntheir offensive potential is interlinked with their defense, in a retaliatory sense.  \nExamples might include: \n \n●​ The Plate brute, who summons up exceedingly heavy armor around themselves, \nbecoming indomitable so long as their armor holds up. \n●​ The Armadillo brute, who gains nigh-impenetrable armor, but only to attacks from \nthe side or rear, with lighter defenses on their front-facing side.  When the \nArmadillo brute absorbs impacts with their heavy armor, retaliates with \nprojectiles. \n●​ The Gargoyle brute, who has a layer of invulnerable shielding that absorbs a set \namount of damage before the shell breaks and the brute is vulnerable.  Comes \nwith secondary power or a brute bonus. \n●​ The Scrapper brute, who uses a power to draw material of a certain type from the \nenvironment, forming a loose shield and using it to augment attacks. \n \nArmor brutes occur when the damage is largely surface level and physical, with damage \nbeing primarily slashing, piercing, or bruising, or the rare burn that is caused by physical \nobjects (ie. abrasion).  This surface level abuse targets the skin while not penetrating a \ngreat deal deeper, or where surface level damage is particularly intense in conjunction \nwith other damage.  Examples might include a backpacker caught in a sandstorm, a \nperson being stoned to death, or a gang initiate being whipped with bike chains. \n \nThe damage suffered can go hand in hand with physical weakness.  This kind of \ndamage leads to blood loss and faltering strength.  This low point is driven home by the \nfact that these kinds of triggers tend to impact appearance in the long-term, which feeds \ninto the changer aspect of the resulting power (the armor that is pulled forth oft being \nchanger-ish).  Self image is deeply affected.  The shard might well find leverage in the \ndifference in self image before and after, with the armor’s aesthetic taking on a dark \ninterpretation drawn from the triggeree’s subconscious, becoming a subtle, dark \nreminder of the event, or, inversely, pushing them to go out in costume by making the \narmor beautiful while its wearer, within, remains scarred.​\n​\nSecondary Armor powers include a light shell of armor that regenerates when"

Their defense is typically \ntop class… when it is situated to block the attack in question.  Alertness, careful \norientation and/or positioning may be necessary to make the most of the power.  In \nmany cases, where the defensive feature needs to be raised to meet an incoming \nattack, Wits may become a key statistic, with a 4+ or higher Wits roll being needed to \nreact in time.  Often comes with minor defensive augments to the parahuman.  \nExamples might include: \n \n●​ The Buckler brute, who maintains a floating shield they can move around them at \nwill.  Blocking incoming attacks with the shield has a beneficial effect, shield itself \nhas limited offensive use in that it knocks foes away. \n●​ The Knight brute, who has a defensive field or impenetrable armor that covers \nonly one half of their body; often the front-facing half or one side. \n●​ The Callisto brute, or Satellite brute, who has floating objects that rotate around \ntheir person, deflecting some hits.  While in the midst of a melee, they can collide \nwith terrain and foes like a wrecking ball.   \n●​ The Catcher brute, who maintains a black hole or pocket reality that they can use \nto store incoming projectiles, to be later released, sometimes in the same form \nthey were captured, other times as a specific kind of attack. \n \nShield brutes come about from visceral, massive damage from a solid, physical entity.  \nBlades, heavy objects, stone, machinery and the like.

Could include a factory worker who is caught in a pneumatic press, \nan embezzling gang member that is fed into a wood chipper, or a soldier who is shot by \na rocket propelled grenade that slams through his lower face but does not go off. \n \nThe sort of trigger that leads to a shield brute will demand some attention or focus from \nthe subject.

The scene, the nature of \nthe entity that did the damage and surrounding elements or factors will be reflected in \nthe theming, any elemental applications, and style of the power, rarely directly, but \nserving as a reminder of the event.

They have a \nvery pronounced offensive lean, but that lean is very short range if not requiring touch, \nand requires them to get into the thick of things to utilize it.  To assist this, they get some \ndefensive powers, which aren’t the focus but do keep them in the fight for long enough \nto tear down their enemies… and oftentimes a great deal of the surrounding property.  \nExamples include:​\n \n●​ The Rampage brute, who grows over time, gaining defensive power every time \nthey smack an enemy down, and offensive power the longer they go without \ntaking damage.  They lean offensively toward muscle and defensively toward \ntheir element, vice versa, or blend it.  Only sustained assaults take them down. \n●​ The Shatter brute, who gathers layers of fragile armor.  While easily broken and \nbroken through, each break creates retaliatory blasts of [element] and leaves the \nshards of the armor rotating around the brute, giving them ammunition for \nprojectile attacks, that grow more intense as the collection grows.

As such, triggering individuals \nmight be a child who disobeys a parent about playing in a kitchen and has their hand \nheld down against an oven burner, a lab worker who loses his protective mask and \nstares into a light intense enough to sear his corneas, or a snitch in prison that has live \nwires placed against either side of their tongue. \n \nThe pain of a burn is often the worst kind of pain, and alongside the damage to a vital \npart, this draws intense focus from the victim.

It can be physical harm, abuse, or something \nmore abstract, with the results falling on a spectrum as a consequence (more damage if \nphysical harm, more side effect if emotional/mental harm).  As opposed to strikers and \nblasters, where the harm is imminent, or brutes, where the harm is actively happening, \nthe mover triggers well in advance or well after, outside of the heat of the moment, and \noften when there is a person or focus responsible.  They utilize elements, as a general \nrule.  A glacial takeoff mover, for example, might leave an expanding circle of growing \nice clusters in their wake, as they leave the situation. \n●​ Takeoff movers produce an effect on departure.  They trigger from closer/known \nrelationships to the source of the ‘I can’t take anymore of this’ harm.  Family, \nblood, long term relationships and relationships extending to childhood, \nfrequently. \n●​ Transit movers produce an effect while traveling.

They trigger from combative, \nknown relationships toward the ‘I can’t take anymore of this’ harm they’re trying \nto escape. \n \nSlip and hurdle movers come about as a result of accumulated small abuses and \nhassles.  There is often a faint brute, breaker, stranger, or changer component feeding \ninto things, as the body is changed and altered to perform the ability.

The situation they are trying to escape is one of being \nmetaphorically pecked to death, often from multiple sources.  The harm is small \nbut impossible to ignore, and rather than culminate in a peak event, it \naccumulates to reach a breaking point. \n●​ Hurdle movers run, leap, climb and/or bound.  The situation they are trying to \nescape is one of harassment - reality pushing well past normal in a sustained \ncampaign of being tracked, dogged, never having a moment to breathe. \n \nThe movers with an emphasis on one movement type generate this type by the nature \nof the problem they are trying to escape.  The emotion of the mover is a key thing here, \nas is the abstract nature of what they’re trying to escape. \n●​ Rocket movers rush toward their destination, but often with little maneuverability.  \nThey trigger as a consequence of a ‘caught in a tunnel with a train imminent’ kind \nof focus, with a big, monumental problem approaching, oftentimes as a \nconsequence of being reckless or foolhardy (with the resulting power’s inability to \neffectively avoid unexpected problems or interruptions mirroring the trigger event \n& actions that led to it).  They woke the dragon or failed to look far enough \nahead. \n●​ Run movers emphasize speed, traveling along the ground.  Speedsters and \nsliders fall into this realm.  They trigger as a consequence of being too grounded.  \nAs opposed to fly movers, they trigger because they’re stuck on rails or in a rut, \nthey neglected the dream in favor of reality. \n●​ Fly movers are airborne.  This can be physical (wings) or by some other \nmechanism.  They trigger as a consequence of reality hitting home, their heads \nwere in the clouds, they had hopes or dreams or a goal they pursued, and when \nit all came crashing down or when they realized they were mortal, they groped for \nthe dream, escaping this newfound and negative reality, and the power offers to \nlift them up again.  Rather common, especially with brute secondaries and \nbreaker secondaries. \n●​ Blink movers teleport.  They move from one point to another without traversing \nthe space in between.  They trigger as a result of being stuck in a box or in a \ntrap, either literal or metaphorical, leading to the desire to escape. \n●​ Ride movers overlap with shakers and use something as a vehicle for travel.  \nThey trigger as a result of the greater environmental or contextual impact on \nwhat they’re wanting to escape."

This is typically an \nemplacement, gateway, launchpad or the like.  The problem they’re trying to \nescape is often institutional, abstract, and longer-term, though not crossing over \ninto the tinker realm. \n●​ Conveyance movers have a great deal of setup but move on a grander scale.  \nMany transport others or pave the way for future mover actions.  In this case, the \nmover action is more tactical and larger-scale, with an emphasis on careful \nplacement at the right time and place, versus actual use of the power during the \nencounter.  This one is hard to pin down and relatively rare: the situations they’re \ntrying to escape are unique cases, typically newsworthy on the national or \ninternational scale."

We’ve discussed your role and positions, but the PRT likes its records, \nand you may find it good to have an email for reference, should you need it.  I know you have a \nlot on your plate. \n \nFollowing the recent destruction, the PRT provided relief funds for Anchorage and the \nsurrounding area.  With this bargaining chip, we are taking a greater role in the redeveloped and \nreinforced city.  The PRT will be setting up shop.  You’re not particularly wanted by the locals, \nbut you’ve got a bit of clout. \n \nUnder the PRT’s umbrella, you’ll have charge over a newly formed set of Protectorate and Ward \nteams.  You have two squads of PRT officers, funding for two years guaranteed, as well as a \ndiscretionary budget to divide up and use as you see fit. \n \nAlaska’s a bitch of a place to set up shop.  The remoteness of it is only one factor.  People who \nfind themselves in a place like that are often getting away from something. It’s not friendly, and a \nlot of people are happier keeping to themselves.  You can’t let things slip on the politics end of \nthings, and you’ll need to keep this in mind when dealing with any of your new capes.  Be they \nally or enemy. \n \nThe area has a notable presence of criminals, though they’re a unique breed.  When the harbor \nwas devastated, the criminals called a ceasefire, pulled together, and offered their assistance to \nsee it restored, so they could continue with their business unmolested.  Tread lightly. \n \nYou should have access to your accounts by the time this email is sent.  You’ll find you have \ngood clearance for all pertinent matters. Conference me if you have any questions, \n \nPiers Reinhold, Deputy Chief Director of the PRT."

He volunteered for placement in \nAnchorage because he feels he would be ‘behind’ if he were to take on full duties at a more \nestablished department.  He also noted, quote, “I like the cold.” \n \nStrictly non-combat in all but the most dire situations, he elects to use his capabilities to assist \nteammates and mend injuries.  As a sought-after cape with healing abilities, Cask may be \nrequisitioned in times of need.  You can request reimbursement for the inconvenience by \nsending a form 554 to both home office and requisitioning office. \n \nPersonality: \nObserved to be somewhat reserved and uninvolved socially.  Genial when spoken to, and \nprofessional in demeanor.  Proves willing to train or study when prompted but will not pursue it \non his own otherwise.  Psych profiles during annual tests are consistently good. \n \nPowers: \nProduces chemical batches that enhance strength, flexibility, resistance to toxins, resistance to \nthe elements, resistance to harm, reflexes, or focus.  Produces chemical batches that quickly \nrestore damaged tissues and prompt rapid cellular growth.  One dose is a minimum of 1.33 \nliters, administered orally, limiting the speed consumption, emergency application and the \nnumber of successive doses that can be given.  Potentially shortens patrol runs or prompts \nsomewhat frequent pit stops. \n \n*Cask treats a physical ailment with regular consumption of a durability-increasing admixture, \nand can be considered to be a low level Brute-class cape at any given time, as a consequence."

After some time spent under \nnotable members of the Protectorate, the consensus is that Horizon has been deemed ready to \ntake the reins of her own team, despite her less than standout powerset.  Her service thus far in \nAnchorage has proved exemplary. \n \nHorizon is a dedicated patroller and is well rated in her interviews and public appearances.  Her \nperformance in the field is exemplary. \n \nPersonality: \nHorizon works well with teammates and imbues those she leads with a natural, easy discipline \nand order.  Horizon has two red marks on her record, stemming from incidents where she chose \nto speak out against what she perceived as wrongs, despite orders to the contrary.  (Conference \nDirectors 22 and 3 for more information).  This may have slowed her advancement.  Annual \npsych profiles are consistently sound, though they point to a chronic frustration.  Achieving her \nnew position should remedy this. \n \nPowers: \nHorizon has three types of enhanced senses.  She can use only one at a time. \n●​ Zoomed sight with simultaneous viewing and processing of multiple scenes in F.O.V. \n●​ Sight through inorganic material.  Can be used to locate persons through walls. \n●​ Organic sight that allows her to see the inner workings of an individual’s body in detail. \nHer striker ability has yet to receive a satisfactory assessment.  It remains unpredictable, linked \nsomehow to the quality (see powers, above) & quantity (time) of focus on a target, in addition to \nother elements that testing has failed to identify.  It has ranged from delivering blows at five or \nso times the usual strength to obliterating large vehicles.

Lightslinger left the team and the \narea, moving to Alaska where he roamed, changing locations with some regularity before being \napproached for placement in Anchorage’s Protectorate team.   \n \nHaving drawn some attention from a high placement in a ‘top fifty capes you’ve never heard of’ \nmagazine article, Lightslinger maintains a fanbase and exceptionally high ratings for his \nincidental appearances.  Take note, however, that his numbers dip when he speaks for a \ncamera.   \n \nPersonality: \nA chronic inability to cooperate remains Lightslinger’s biggest drawback, largely due to his \nexperience in ‘Eminent’.  Inter-member competition was promoted by the group structure and \nthe incentives offered to team members, leading to fierce rivalries, one of which might have \nprompted Lightslinger to leave the team. \n \nLightslinger proves cocky and confident, not helped by the fact that he is extremely good at \nwhat he does.  He naturally seeks out studying and fitness regimens on his own.  If he were to \nget a handle on his inability to work with others or the arrogant attitude that tanks his PR ratings, \nthe PRT expects he could become a nationally recognized member of the Protectorate. \n \nPowers: \nLightslinger magnifies the light generated by all nearby sources.  Sources of sufficient size that \nhave been altered can then fire weaponized forms of radiant energy.  This energy can be made \ndiffuse, reducing the power to safe levels.  Direction and intensity of fire can be adjusted with a \nthought, but only one emplacement at a time, or every emplacement simultaneously.  Lightbulbs \nare at the low end of this scale, with low-watt bulbs proving insufficient to become an \nemplacement.  Brighter sources generate more firepower."

In his previous identity as WRD_TRAPPER, he established habits that \nmay be hard to break.  He has taken on a role as something of a hot potato, to be passed \naround departments until he finds himself somewhere he can’t be easily dismissed.  He will set \ndown roots until those in charge find the means to move him along. \n \nHe maintains a minor but steadfastly loyal following.  In 2010 Snaptrap was approached about a \nreality television deal.  He ultimately rejected the offer when the PRT informed him he would not \nbe able to retain the PRT owned name of Snaptrap. \n \nSnaptrap is a capable combatant with some surprising credits in his file, a devastating force in \nthe field, serious and dedicated in his patrols, possibly to a fault.  Care must be taken to ensure \nhe does not patrol overmuch in his off time and that he attends to his paperwork. \n \nPersonality: \nBlunt, crude, brusque, Snaptrap has yet to find a situation where he is on good terms with both \nthe local Director (or Directors) and his Protectorate team leader.  Restless and solitary, he \nthrows himself into his work to an unhealthy degree and maintains no social life beyond his \nteam, which is typically divided in its tolerance of him.  Minor infractions include making obscene \ngestures at the press, drinking, smoking, using legal drugs disallowed by the PRT, unsanctioned \nfraternizing with teammates, and unsanctioned fraternizing with press.  He has yet to use undue \nviolence on a teammate or opponent, nor has he committed any moderate or serious \ninfractions.  His ability to follow orders seems to correlate directly with his level of respect for his \nsuperiors. \n \nPowers: \nSnaptrap creates gravity spheres that drag all things touching them to the sphere’s center.  He \ncan weaponize a sphere, giving it a shredding or cutting exterior, or using the interior to crush \nthings.  The pull and a timed dismissal of the sphere can ‘toss’ persons and objects."

She continued her \nwork until a sudden, unprovoked nervous breakdown.  The NY office surveyed the case and \ndecided that her leadership abilities and her defensive powers were too great an asset to give \nup, electing to move her to Anchorage.  Thus far she has continued to show her recommended \nleadership abilities, and was instrumental in inviting a damaged individual to custody. \n \nAuroch rates well but not exceptionally in her public appearances, despite a few rebranding \nattempts and costume redesigns.  This may be due to a lack of commanding demeanor the \npublic has come to expect from team leaders.  Nonetheless, she inspires loyalty from Wards \nunder her, and is capable at tactically applying them, proving better than most.  In the field she \nis a devastating and dramatic force. \n \nWhile she recuperates, Auroch will remain on the Wards team past the age of eighteen, pending \nreviews.  As far as the public is concerned, she is still under eighteen. \n \nPersonality: \nAuroch is friendly, assertive, and was reasonably confident before her psychotic break.  She \nresponds well to authority and interacts well with people in positions above or below her, cape \nor civilian.  She consistently underperforms in her day to day in school but does well on final \nexaminations and major assignments.  She has a good relationship with her parents. \n \nPowers: \nAuroch generates an effect around her that either dampens inertia, protecting and slowing \nthings in the area, or accelerating them to prompt faster, less controlled movement.

She is clearly attempting to find a means of coping, but more \ntroubling is her rejection of outside aid. Her confidence is failing her, and her ability to lead has \nbeen clearly compromised, as she is accepting advice and counsel from teammates who are \nnot qualified to give it. I’ve had a discussion with her, and I’ve mandated psychological \ncounseling. \nDirector Knox, Note:​\nAuroch’s grades are slipping, necessitating that I send staff to the school, and oversight is \nstarting to take note. Psych sessions are not helping as much as I hoped. We had an incident \nwith a patrol, where Auroch second guessed her initial orders and agreed to move forward with \nan aggressive play as Flambé was arguing for. To say this is an error in judgement is putting it \nlightly; Flambé’s reckless tendencies and peculiar mental state are so well known that even the \nnine year old on our team would ignore his advice. Nobody was hurt, but I’ve suspended Auroch \nfrom her position as leader of the second LA Wards’ team. \nDirector Knox, Note:​\nRemoving Auroch from her leadership position was a mistake. Her confidence was already \nshaken, and she’s not doing well without this pillar and position in her life. I worry about the \neffects, but I’ve relieved her from the team entirely, until she’s completed more psych sessions \nand taken a vacation. I’m hoping she takes the time to tend to her civilian life and family. \nDirector Knox, Note:​\nMy hopes for Auroch’s condition were raised considerably with my periodic visits with her over \nthese past few months, only to be dashed. She had an outburst with no apparent cause, \nshouting, directing physical violence at inanimate objects, used her power in public (thankfully \nunobserved, as far as we can tell), and was almost entirely dissociated from reality when we \napproached her. I fear this is a long-delayed reaction to the death of her father and several of \nher friends.  Our in-house psychologist expressed interest in studying her mental state, \nsomething about an agent interjection, parahuman inability to remain on standby, all garbage. \nHis attitude about Auroch herself was cold and uncaring, all things considered. To say I’m \ndispleased would be stating it lightly; he’s been fired and I intend to ensure he doesn’t find \nfurther employment anywhere near the PRT. \nDirector Knox, Final Note:​\nAuroch and psychologists have a consensus that she’s ready to work, now, but has requested \ntransfer.

          "text": "◈ HOSTILES; The Elite​\n \nThe largest villain organization and arguably the second-largest parahuman organization in the \nUnited States, the Elite got their start in San Francisco as ‘Uppermost’, an organization of \nrogues organized by rogues, involved in production and entertainment, managed by \nparahumans.  In 1998, Uppermost reached out to the PRT for assistance in dealing with a bill \n(NEPEA-5) that sought to curtail parahuman involvement in business and media, arguably \ntargeted directly at Uppermost.  After a great deal of consideration, the head office  turned down \nthe offer for assistance, the bill was passed, and Uppermost disbanded.  Many members of \nUppermost found their way to the Protectorate and Wards as a way of avoiding bankruptcy and \nto manage the fines and fees that followed the bill’s passage.​\n​\nThe events that followed have been pieced together from hearsay and investigation - \nUppermost’s core group divided and started up their own businesses and independent \ndirections, still in the open, in keeping with NEPEA-5.  Unbeknownst to the PRT and the public, \nthis group of members were still in contact.  By the time it became apparent what they were \ndoing, the new group, dubbed the Elite, had combined assets, employees and businesses \nquintupling Uppermost at its peak, and formed a loose confederation.  Many core members \nhave been supplanted by a more ruthless leadership, titling themselves after elements of the \naristocracy.  At the same time, however, despite the ‘hostiles’ designation in the files, the Elite \nare not open adversaries of the PRT.  Cooperation or interaction with the Elite is a hotly debated \nsubject within the PRT, from the lowest to the highest levels; the Elite do reduce crime numbers \nwhere they are active, but they also aggressively target rogues and powerful parahumans the \nPRT would rather support.  While official judgment is pending, the present stance is to address \nthe Elite on a case by case basis.​\n​\nThe Elite does not pursue traditional villainous enterprises, though they may temporarily \nmaintain connections to organized crime if it suits their purposes.  If they have any pattern, it is \nto seize an area on the highest level -economic or political-, then undermine local opposition on \nthe fundamental level with sabotage, blitzkrieg-style strikes, remaining consistently off the \npublic’s radar by subterfuge or careful manipulation of media. \n​\nThe organization forms a loose pyramid-style structure of cells.  The head cell, based in San \nFrancisco, manages interests on the national scale, while each step down involves a step down \nin scale.  The Elite expect villains and groups to be beholden to the Elite and nobody else, \nRogues are folded into the organization, and resistance is systematically crushed.  Once an \narea is firmly under control, these resources are leveraged to expand elsewhere. \n​\nThe Elite currently control territories across the Western seaboard, maintaining presences in: \n◈  California​\n​\n◈  Nevada​\n​\n◈  Arizona \n◈  Washington​◈  Idaho​\n​\n◈  Oregon \n◈  Florida​\n​\n◈  N.Y.

This \nensures a safe environment for parahumans; it allows for stabilized, healthy interactions \nbetween parahumans and the unpowered; and it grants the PRT the ability to better answer \nthreats. \n \nRecruitment:  Funding \n \nTo better support the primary goal, any department that recruits a new member is awarded \neighteen months stipend for salary and general costs, as well as funding to supply branding, \nequipment and costume.  These funds are not drawn from that department, but are provided in \naddition to standard funding.   \n \nAs base discretionary funding is calculated from total costs, the department’s discretionary \nfunding should increase as a result of the artificial increase to total costs.  The department will \nhave more funds rather than less, as the size increases.  Barring issue, this should promote \ndepartment growth and boost discretionary funding on its own. \n \nTo discourge departments from repeated firing and re-hiring of capes, this bonus is only \nawarded once, and the additional stipend is cancelled immediately should the cape leave (see \nTermination, below).  It will not be reinstated."

Additional salary may be allowed by the department, typically to \naccommodate housing costs for a particular area or in response to other skills the junior \nmember brings to the table, as appreciation for the value it brings to the team or as a \ncompetitive offer.   \n \nJunior members are effectively probationary members, cannot lead a team, and have restricted \npermissions for confidential data and sensitive material. \n \nTrue probationary members are members with probationary status under the law and a proven \nhistory of illegal conduct.

Adaptable personal style. \n \nGeneral:  Clay maintains a long history of undercover operations, having been pulled into such \nas soon as her graduation to detective.  She remains passable as middle eastern, black or \nlatino, affecting accents with ease.  She was working undercover as a henchman when a \nbuilding was bombed.

With the \nmental age of an eight year old and several tertiary problems (a stutter, eye problems, and the \nrare seizure) Grumman harbors further issues due to the accidental murder of his own father. \n \nAll this in mind, Grumman remains an exemplary cape.  He must patrol with others, and needs \nsome direction, but is determined, positive, and his powers set him head and shoulders above \nthe norm.  His teammates remain fond of him, and his superiors have yet to levy a single \ncomplaint his way.  Rather than interrupt matters with constant psychological and medical \nappointments, Grumman sees a caseworker once a week.  He has a request pending to leave \nToronto; the Toronto PRT is restructuring to fund new initiatives, and his mother desires a move. \n \nPersonality:  Grumman, by all reports, remains eminently reliable, provided certain \nprecautionary measures are taken.  Positive, social, patient, kind, and unfailing in his belief that \nhe’s bettering the world, Grumman excels with simple tasks and careful direction.   He may \nrequire some counsel, preparation and/or urging to use his power offensively against living \ntargets, and still harbors some trauma from the death of his father.

That’s a \ngood cue for a tinker.  Most debate in the group is about the fact that most \nmasters have a time component already, and you need an especially \nmaster-tinker power to not just make it one or the other.

In this case, we start with a mover power and apply a Stranger quality to it.  \nSuch powers often have a twist or the like to spice them up, or are part of a combination. \n \n \nThe Shaker-Stranger Combination \n \nShaker-Stranger combinations are the ones where the walls are closing in, metaphorically \nspeaking.  The attention is environmental or abstract enough to have no source that can be \npointed to.  Hallucinations, paranoia, or places with extreme negative connotations will produce \nthis sort of effect.  The idea of being watched or having attention directed at an individual may \nbe purely in the triggeree’s head, or it may be real.  A young lady finds one hidden camera set in \nher room, and starts tearing the room apart, finding one, then another, then another.  A paranoid \nagoraphobe who hasn’t stepped foot outside their apartment in a year is convinced the \nmurmuring on the other side of the walls is all the neighbors talking about them, and it gets \nlouder and louder until they trigger. \n \nThe core idea with the power is that a Shaker effect is delivered, but the result is Stranger-ish.  \nArea effect coverage with individuals affected, distractions, or avenues for entry.  Examples \ninclude perception altering gas clouds, forcefield constructs that help provide cover or mislead \npursuers, and area-effect gravity tilts that allow alternate forms of approach/access.  In devising \nthe power, the idea is to have a shaker vector for a stranger effect.  Such powers are rarely \ndirectly damaging, and are often very effective against a crowd. \n \nThe Brute-Stranger Combination \n \nThe Brute-Stranger combination is rare, given that unwanted attention and personal bodily harm \ndon’t necessarily go hand-in-hand, and when they do they tend to take other forms than Brute.  \nIn this case, the personal harm and the attention are often the same thing, or closely correlated.  \nAn abusive partner strangles the triggeree, telling them they have to report in once an hour \nwhile at work or every ten minutes otherwise, that they will know what the triggeree is doing at \nall times, or else.  A man being hunted like an animal is shot with a modified tracking device in a \nvital area. \n \nIn these cases, the defensive aspect of the Brute power and the indirect nature of the Stranger \npower intertwine.  Being unnoticed or more evasive is a form of self defense, because it means \ngetting hit less at the end of the day.  Examples include an armor of a component that surrounds \nthe brute in a thick mist, masking their exact location, or a personal shield that, when broken, \nteleports the Brute-Stranger to a hiding space, giving them a chance to let the shield recuperate. \n \nThe Breaker-Stranger Combination"

A young \nprofessional suffering from dwindling faculties due to a hidden illness is called before the heads \nof their organization to prove themselves and fails utterly due to the disease, knowing they’ll \nnever get a career in this field again, as the eyes of these people watch them.  A stepfather \nleans too heavily on the triggeree; in the eyes of everyone else he’s trying to build a relationship \nwith his new daughter.  He doesn’t give her a moment to breathe, and she can’t escape the \npressure or the panic attacks, with her triggering as he admits in a whisper that it’s intentional \nand predatory. \n \nThe breaker state in this case enables the Stranger effect.

Such powers are often complementary to other powers, or tangential to a greater \nstranger power.  The ability to track where people are and/or how aware they are of the \nparahuman, enhanced skills in stealth or lying, or clairvoyant awareness of security systems \nand door locks are fairly lacklustre as individual powers, but can shape and direct a more \ncomplete package. \n \nThe Striker-Stranger Combination \n \nStriker-strangers tend to be vigilantes or assassins in methodology, stemming from their trigger \nevent.  This tends to involve a striker trigger, a singular person or object posing an immediate, \nin-your-face threat to one’s well being, but with a deeply personal relationship and \noverwhelming, intense focus stemming from that relationship.  The relationship can be from a \nperson or group, but is often singular.  A young woman is kidnapped by a childhood friend, now \npsychotic and obsessed with her, the trigger occurring when he starts to tattoo her as a mark of \nhis ownership.  A young man with a mercurial, creepy relationship with his mother is stopped \nfrom moving out by her threat of suicide, followed by her turning the weapon on him.  The \nmentality it takes to trigger and lash out feeds into revenge-seeking behavior, even in an \nabstract sense. \n \nSuch powers tend to fall into two categories: either the trigger is abstract and not physically \nthreatening, in which case it’s a striker power with nonlethal effects conducive to stranger \nactivity, such as a sense-stealing, blinding, confusion, or passage-opening power, or it is a"

          "text": "physical threat, and the package lends itself to a more ‘assassination’ style, with stranger \npowers complementing the striker one to encourage attacking from behind, entering and exiting \nthe battlefield, or taking out unaware targets or slipping past the front line to take out vulnerable \ntargets on the back line.  This might be a cape who inconsistently slips in and out of the visual \nspectrum, with a powerful energy blade that only lasts a second at most, good for an \nall-or-nothing strike, or a striker who is only visible when he is within 15 feet of his target, \nenabling him to close the gap. \n \n \n \nThe Changer-Stranger Combination \n \nChanger-strangers are, alongside master-strangers, perhaps the most common pairing.  The \npowers are often complementary and the triggers themselves fold into one another nicely - \nstrangers come about from an excess of attention, and changers come about from a crisis of \nidentity, often from the rest of the world impugning on the individual’s sense of self, which rarely \ncomes without some level of unwanted attention.  Many changers have some stranger elements \nin play, and vice versa.  Triggers might include a gay person outed in front of the school, or a \nman in court having his criminal past dredged out while his wife, children, and extended family \nwatch in aghast horror. \n \nChanger-stranger powers often involve changing one’s physical appearance, mimicking others, \nor using altered shape to slip in where an ordinary person couldn’t get.  The stranger and \nchanger aspects thus blend together seamlessly (for much this reason, the changer category is \nsometimes referred to as shifter, an old designation for this specific eventuality).  Examples \ninclude stretching limbs, liquid form to seep through keyholes, or the ability to alter one’s face \nand mannerisms to match another individual. \n \nThe Blaster-Stranger Combination \n \nArising from situations where one faces a more remote but poignant threat & hostile, unwanted \nattention, the Blaster/Stranger is obviously a common occurrence on the lowest level - very few \nremote but poignant threats aren’t paying some degree of attention to the subject of the trigger.  \nTypically, however, this manifests as a touch of stranger-ness; a fireball might produce smoke, \nbriefly obscuring view, a bolt of warped reality might create a concussive sound, adding an extra \nlevel of disruption.  Triggers that truly combine both prominent stranger and blaster elements \nmight include a man on the run from his physically abusive cop girlfriend and her partner, \nstalked until finally confronted, or a person loosed into the wild by an expert hunter, tracker, and \nserial killer who then hunts them for sport. \n \nTrue Blaster-stranger powers are rarely strictly offensive, doing little damage, but instead alter \nsenses or have elements of misdirection or maximize confusion.  A fired projectile might involve \nnauseating stench, a cape might shotgun-blast hologram images that knock people back but do"

It tends to arise from triggers tied into other Strangers and \nThinker powers.  Being stalked by a Case 53 with enhanced senses, or a Thinker using powers \nto dig up one’s secrets and expose them out of spite might qualify. \n \nTrumps take on any number of forms, making it hard to pin down specifics for how such a cape \nmight turn out.  A Trump-Stranger can be a cape with a stranger ‘element’ with the venue for \nexpressing that element varying, such as a darkness power that changes from blaster to shaker \nto breaker modes, or the other way around, with a stranger power that changes in how it is \nexpressed, like a shadowy cloak that alternates between smoke, darkness, hallucinatory \nimages, or the like.  It can also include power thieves/nullifiers, often utilizing ambush and \nstranger powers to access targets who can be stolen from."

Leaning heavily toward the offensive by dint of \nwhat parahumans are, Strikers are in large part an extension of the same tools the \nentities use to interact with their environment.

They arise from multiple, similar points of danger.  Two people cornering them, \none person with multiple weapons, or an imminent attack from a pack of animals. \n \nReach strikers can strike from a further distance away.  They join Etch strikers as being \na blurring of the lines between blaster and striker, but they do it by being melee with \nreach rather than having some ranged ability.   \n \nRumble strikers are focused on impact, size, and breaking foes or terrain.  Generally \nthey hit hard and do a lot of damage to their target or property.  Rumble strikers trigger \nfrom environmental effects of the immediate and sudden sort. \n \nEtch strikers empower objects with qualities, generally empowering or modifying \nweapons.  This may include ranged weapons, but the lean will be toward melee, with \nranged weapons being inaccurate past a point, or the weapon suffering for the effect \nbeing on it.  Etch strikers trigger when a threat becomes untouchable, whether by \nmoving out of range (while still posing a threat) or seizing a circumstantial advantage.   \n \nTorch strikers don’t necessarily emphasize damage, instead having a typically \ndeleterious effect they can apply with touch or at melee range.  Torch strikers are \nthreatened at the moment of trigger with the loss of something fundamental… but this is \nthe loss of something that isn’t their own physical well being, but often a precious \npossession, loved one, their own status or reality, or more abstracted aspects of their \nlives. \n \nSkirmish strikers emphasize positioning, with maneuvering, pushing, pulling, and \nmovement leading into and/or out of the strike being possible executions.  Skirmish \nstrikers may have a mover or movement aspect to the trigger, being harried, harassed, \nstruck while trying to flee, or having movement be critical to the attacker’s approach, \nsuch as being attacked from a fast-moving mount.  \n \nSwathe strikers have strikes that affect multiple targets in range by way of \narea-covering melee effects, cleaving strikes or damaging effects that ripple out from \nstruck targets.  Triggers that lead to this kind of power stem from environmental effects \nin the trigger, generally of a sort that puts them at a disadvantage over the course of an \nencounter that goes downhill, rather than the immediate and sudden (Rumble strikers)."

The key focus in \ndetermining what the methodology is, as stated above, the nature of the problem the \ntinker faces, in the course of the trigger. \n \nIn brief, the categories and the circumstances that flavor them are: \n●​ Hyperspecialist - obsession regarding an object or goal. \n●​ Focal - Obsession on a singular behavior, pattern or path. \n●​ Limit - Obsession tied to a person or relationship. \n●​ Binary - Trigger involved a crossroads or a lose-lose situation. \n●​ Combat - Violence or threats extending over a long time. \n●​ Chaos - Triggers defined by a question mark or unsolvable problem. \n●​ Resource Tinkers - Triggers having to do with materialism, belongings. \n●​ Controllers - Triggers defined by personal/relationship aspect. \n●​ Architect - One man vs. the world, or fighting an institution, David vs. Goliath. \n●​ Mad Scientist - Facing consequences, often from bad risk/reward gambles \n \nNot yet added are the… \n●​ Magi - Tinkers that focus on utility or self improvement \n●​ Free Tinkers - Who can build anything they dream of. \n \nThis determines the manner in which the tinker gets inspiration, the ease with which \nthings can be researched, their breadth (or narrowness) of specialty, the breadth, range, \nand restrictions of what they can build, the resource costs, the bonuses and penalties, \nand more. \n \nA given trigger, however, oft falls into more than one category, and GMs and groups are \nencouraged, if stuck, to identify two that apply, when and where that’s possible.

A compulsive gambler breaks as he makes a bid to get \nenough money together to get his daughter a birthday present, the latest and perhaps \nmost crushing disappointment in a long string of failures.  A young woman with an anger \nproblem and history of being abused keeps picking volatile partners, every relationship \nending with one or both parties in jail or seriously injured, and triggers as she stands \nover the corpse of the latest one.  A compulsive liar keeps the fact that he dropped out \nof University hidden from family and friends, but the lies build up and become \npathological… until he can’t juggle them all and the house of cards comes tumbling \ndown. \n \nThe nature of the item itself feeds in large part on the attitudes leading into the trigger \nand the critical moment of the trigger itself; use classifications to inform the item of \nchoice.  The gambler described above might have a thinker trigger with notes of \nchanger, a mask or suit with high feedback/information storage/use.  The woman with \nthe anger problem gets a striker-esque sword or weapon set.  The liar, isolated, gets a \nMaster drone or pet."

While they do best in their field of specialty, they dip their toes into \nother waters, or even have to dip their toes to operate at their best, with optimal \noperation tied to peripheral objects, focuses, or added complexities.  Examples include: \n \n●​ [Heterodyne removed - description needed for another] \n●​ The Catalyst tinker, who is akin to a specialist, but who keeps their specialty \nsecret until a critical moment.  Develops gear of varying sorts and a relatively low \npower level, but in reality is setting things up for a singular dramatic effect at the \npress of a button, where everything kicks over to another mode or function. \n●​ The Mastermind tinker, who is a specialist unaware of their specialty; they can \nbuild outside of it, but not well, or with misfire chances.  Every field test of varied, \nmoderate-level tinkerings helps narrow this down.  Finding their specialty unlocks \na megaproject or another bonus. \n \nThe Limit tinker derives from a situation with a singular focus or obsession, and this \nfocus or obsession is either very abstract (touching on the blurred lines in the actual \nbuild/specialty) or, more often, relates to a person.  The relationship can be positive or \nadversarial, but is overwhelming and all-encompassing, and the situation tying into that \nrelationship is often so intense that there is no rest or relaxation.  Other triggers tie into \nrelationships, but there is a period of rest or a break from the situation.  Not so here.   A \nminister loses her faith and her life is consumed as she struggles to recapture it.  A teen \nis controlled by their father, homeschooled, diet constrained, clothing chosen, allowed \nentertainment pre-screened, until they feel as if they are suffocating.  A boy’s sister is \nkidnapped while they are traveling, and he carries out a vigilante quest to find her and \nmake amends for letting her out of his sight, triggering when hospitalized for not eating \nor sleeping for days, fully aware he’s now lost the only lead. \n \nThe relationship is the key factor here in determining what the condition or outside \nfactor is in enabling or optimizing the specialty.  The minister fumbles, blind, for faith, the \nspecialty unclear to them as well - their limit is needing to figure it out.  The child is \nsubmerged and drowning in an ocean of parental attention/control, and thus gathers \nstrength/focus to use non-specialist gear as they might fight to the metaphorical surface.  \nThe vigilante puts health at risk in pursuit of their sister, and might face a risk of misfire \nwhen using non-specialty gear, mirroring that risk to themselves in much the same \nmanner."

Take, for example: \n \n●​ The Dexter tinker, who can build within two separate specialties, but when those \nspecialties overlap, gets a bonus to two of the following (set at character \ncreation): quality/power, cost efficiency of building, or time efficiency of building.  \nCannot build outside of the specialty, and may be limited from scanning or \ndrawing inspiration from outside sources, providing a fairly tight, limited toolkit. \n●​ The Amplitude tinker, who is akin to the Heterodyne tinker (A Binary Tinker/Limit \nTinker combo), building within two specialties, with gear running at a lower power \nlevel at the outset of confrontation.  Utilizing confrontation (ie. successfully \nblasting enemies) or specific features in environment (more fire!), can step up \namplitude of one specialty while stepping down the other. \n●​ The Necromancer tinker, who builds within two specialties.  Is restricted to only \none or two items to begin with, as the further outside the center of the \nvenn-diagram that tinker builds, the more reliant they are on power sources, \nspecial feeds or vectors.  In this case, the dead, dying, or comatose. \n \nBinary tinkers arise from a crossroads, two major, long-term problems coming to a \nhead, in a lose/lose situation or a compounding effect.  A gang leader is dying, but \ncannot afford to look weak or give others the opportunity of seeing him go to get \ntreatment, so he lets his health falter.  A salaryman is being sabotaged/undermined in \nhis career, and goes home every night to take care of a wife who has recently turned \npsychotic, stressing about what she’s getting up to at work.  If he stays at work, she \ngets up to trouble, but if he goes to take care of her, he accomplishes nothing while \nlosing ground at work.  If the problem builds up until he cracks, that’s a lose/lose \n(minimal overlap), but if she storms into the workplace, raving, a convergence (strong \ninterplay).   \n \nEach problem informs a separate specialty, how they meet informs the dynamic & \ninteraction at play in the Binary.  The specialties are drawn from abstract elements; slow \ndegradation of health and a false strength and command for the gang leader touching \non dual specialties of radiation and physical augmentation, with physically augmented \nradiation mutants in the venn, while the man at work might mix mind altering effects \n(problem: psychotic wife) and trap-making (problem: sabotage at work)."

They often find themselves very good at those applications, get some \nadded bonuses or options in their tinkering to make up for the lack of breadth or options \noutside of combat, or get secondary powers to complement their style.  Includes: \n \n●​ The Ironclad tinker, who is strictly limited to one specialty and to combat \napplications, but is exceedingly dangerous in combat, often with very durable \ngear and power armor that proves both potent and versatile, with lots of \ndefensive modifications tacked on. \n●​ The Executioner, a combat-biased tinker with the ability to attach highly modular \n‘blank slots’ to their gear.  Where other tinkers learn from scanning threats and \nscenarios and then taking their scans to the workbench, expanding their \nrepertoire, the Executioner can ‘learn’ by defeating enemies, then immediately \napply that learning to their gear, to varying degrees of effectiveness.  Oft touches \non the Trump classification. \n●​ The Templar, a power-armor wearing tinker, with weapon options being primarily \nmelee or very short ranged, forcing the tinker to get into the fray.  A shard-gear \nlink allows the tinker to charge up gear for special actions by attacking in melee. \n \nCombat tinkers arise from a threat to one’s person, of a physical nature.  Such threats \nexist over the long-term, but typically require a special element to make them into a \ntinker trigger rather than another classification with long-term context: the threat has to \nbe present for a time, be relentless, or have a problem-solving aspect tied into it.  A little \ngirl is physically abused by her father, and after being hospitalized by a recent attack, is \ntold that the next knock to her head could cause brain damage or exacerbate an \nongoing health problem.  A young man knows the physically abusive older brother he \ntestified against is getting out of jail soon, is going to kill him when it happens, and he \ncan’t find a way out, lacking funding or ability to leave the city.  Helplessness and \nfrustration are common elements here, as are close relations to the attacker. \n \nA key element here is the aspect of melee vs. range vs. defense, both in the long and \nthe short term.  The girl’s father is always in close proximity, using his fists.  She triggers \nwith a leaning toward melee and armor, especially with the health problems as a \nconcern.  The boy who fears his brother has his brother as a distant threat, drawing \nnearer in the short term, and emphasizes armor less, with an emphasis on an array of \nguns and a few good melee weapons."

Chaos tinkers don’t generally have to give consideration to the same \nfactors that other tinkers do, but the element of randomness takes the place of those \nfactors. \n \n●​ The Inspired has a field of specialty.  On sitting down to build, they get their \nchoice of several options in that field.  Over time, can touch on any/every base, \nor deconstruct items to keep aspects of them, leading to great breadth, at cost of \nshort-term decision making. \n●​ The Lens tinker has no control over fields of specialty or item type, unless they \ncan collect special materials, which enable the tinker to nail one or both down.  \nStarts off with a random assortment of gear, but once a source for these rare \nmaterials is obtained, the tinker can customize their own focus. \n●​ The Horror has some shifter/breaker ability.  At the outset of a confrontation, their \nbody adopts one of a limited list of weapons and power sources.  Pre-built \nweapon housings and power sources (incomplete on their own) can be plugged \ninto these morphed parts to be effectively completed, or, as an arduous process, \ncompleted standalone so as to be more reliable.​\n \nChaos tinkers arise from situations where the tinker trigger has a high degree of \nconfusion or missing information.  They face a long-term problem, and the problem can’t \nbe solved because of a big question mark in the midst of it all.  For example, an agent of \na high ranking agency figures out that they have a terrorist mole, putting the team in \nmortal jeopardy, can’t tell anyone without possibly informing the mole, their only option \nbeing to find the mole.  The trigger point is when they lose their last lead or when the \nmole makes their first (devastating move), and the identity of the mole still remains \nunknown.  A man who repressed his memories of childhood has his past catch up to \nhim after he wins the lottery, with dangerous and abusive family members suddenly \npaying attention to him, and he can’t actively unrepress his memories and figure out \nwho/what to watch for, because every attempt to dig or remember only triggers his \ndefense mechanisms. \n \nIn creating Chaos Tinkers, very frequently a partial list of builds is given to the player, \nwith the remainder being put into a table that the GM can roll on, providing options to \nthe player when necessary.

The Resource Tinker has certain allowances, dependencies, or abstract  \nfactors when it comes to the question of what they can build.  This could include \nneeding no or far less resources to get started, needing certain very rare or specialized \nmaterials to build, or having the material be the focus of the tinker’s particular method.  \nExamples: \n \n●​ The Midas tinker, who can utilize exceedingly rare materials to produce special \ncomponents; when used in crafting, by the Midas tinker or another individual, the \ncomponent adds a powerful bonus augment.  A fairly subpar tinker if they can’t \nobtain their sapphire stolen from a museum (as an example), very powerful if \nthey can. \n●​ The Crude tinker, a hyperspecialist who eschews all complex materials in favor of \na ‘junkyard’ or ‘mad max’ build style.  They can build with bare bones minimum of \nmaterials, build quick ad-hoc stuff if they do have materials, or pile on extra \nmaterials to build hardy, but their work is heavy, loud, and noxious. \n●​ The Muster tinker, a combat tinker who doesn’t need many materials at all.  A \ngiven fist-sized node serves as a blueprint and an engine to slowly gather \nmaterials from the area and ‘summon’ a tinker device or armor around the \nnode… with a time limit before the item falls apart.  Nodes gain ‘experience’ of a \nsort, retaining materials within, making for better quality and faster activation over \nsuccessive uses. \n \nResource tinkers arise from long-term problems of materialism.  Money, possessions, \ngreed, material needs and objects being the subject of other triggers factor into \nresource tinkering, being reflected in the needs, lack thereof, or the materials that form \nthe focus.  Examples include a person married to a gambling addict, who fights a long, \nslow fight to get their spouse on the right track, only to trigger when they realize that \ntheir inheritance from their dead parent has been gambled away.  A person with a rare \ndisease struggles to get the medical equipment necessary to stay alive after the one \ncompany that made it closes down.  A teenager who hit it big as a child actor finds that \nall their friends only want them for their money and cool stuff, not for them as people. \n \nOften, the nature of the resource tinker reflects the trigger in that those that need are \ngiven tinkerings that need materials.  Those that covet special things are given powers \nthat work off of rare components, and so on.  Specialties are oft drawn from the nature \nof the coveted item."

He amasses squads and \narmies, his focus primarily on soldiers, which range from simple mooks to mooks \nmodified to capitalize on the tinker’s specialty.  A Nuke spec M.O. tinker might \nhave five humanoid minions with melee weapons and two upgraded ones that \ncan self-destruct, or work to outfit minions with tinkerized rocket launchers. \n●​ The Geppetto tinker is a drone tinker who maintains a singular drone (hereafter \nreferred to as the puppet).

The tinker’s tinkerings are primarily \nfocused on augments, advancements, and weapon additions to their puppet, \nincluding some that give it some autonomy. \n \nControllers manifest from a trigger that is largely social and ‘cold’ emotionally in the \nsense that it deals with isolation, detachment, or depression, serving in large part as the \ntinker equivalent of a Master-Tinker trigger.  Noting that many Master triggers have \nsome long-term effects in play, Controller triggers are usually very long term or involve a \nsteady progression of worsening social problems over a more typical tinker-level long \nterm.

The goal and the benefit is to vastly increase \ntheir own capabilities, skills and awareness, with some secret weapons (face \nunfolding to reveal sudden laser blast), a growing assortment of secondary tech \nor weapons that operate with a thought, and a very high ceiling for development. \nVariants can exist, covering other bases (Lead Foot Tinker, for example). \n●​ The Witch is akin to a power armor tinker, but deals with an assortment of tools \nor weapons rather than armor.

The end product of a tinker’s \ncreations, oftentimes weapons, will do more damage.  Need not be a flat \nincrease to wounds done, but could include more damage to terrain, staggering \nhit enemies, armor penetration, or the like.  Generally applies to the tinker’s \nprimary focus, defaulting to weapons when this isn’t clear.  If a tinker cannot build \nweapons or only builds weapons as a secondary thing, but does create drones, \nthen the drone’s attack output may be increased.  A Magi tinker who builds \ncyborg implants that increase their skills might gain more oomph on the skill \nfront.​\n \n●​ Efficiency covers the cost in time and money that goes toward building.  With \nincreased efficiency, the amount of resources and time needed to build is \nreduced, or the tinker may get bonus % toward builds and research.  In the latter \ncase, they would get, say, 133% build efficiency; the bonus % would carry over \nand every three builds they would get a bonus item created.​\n \n●​ Scope generally means range, but in the context of a tinker, it applies to the \nrange of things the tinker can build.  With increased scope, the tinker’s ability to \npush at the boundaries of their usual build options is increased.  For those with a \nlimited range of fields or items available to them, it might simply relax the \nrestrictions.  For others, this generates the same result as Precision, below.​\n \n●​ Precision (Accuracy/Awareness) is the ability of the tinker to produce what they \nwant.  ​"

The tinker starts out with knowledge of some mix of 3-8 list \nA items. \n \nWhen creating the build lists, the GM identifies the list A items that fit that tinker \napproach.  Most tinkers will get some basic supplies that enable them to function in \ncombat - a gun and a bodysuit.  That leaves 1-6 items to fill out.  In short, we’re asking \n‘what do they build?’  ‘What’s the approach?’ \n \nEsme’s tinker, nicknamed an ‘Axecalibur’ tinker by the group, is a [combat x \nfocal] tinker; such tinkers aren’t about having a ton of options on List A.

(Social) \n●​ Augment: Data - Connection to other tech, computers, increase depth. \n(Knowledge). \n●​ Augment: Heavy - Durability, toughness, weight.  (Guts) \n \nAugments are normally only granted to characters who really specialize in something or \nwhere patterns don’t fit. \n \nAugments, for example, are an option for vehicle tinkers who want to customize their \nvehicle more, for controllers with drones that can be customized or given additional \nabilities, or for focal tinkers with one item they work well with."

Some \ntinkers (Architects) are built around creating megaprojects, while others have it as an \noption, and yet others do not have the ability. \n \nMegaprojects have to be researched in multiple stages, and during the research \nprocess, the tinker will be able to outline the kind of project they want to make, in \nkeeping with their specialty and methodology.   \n \nGenerally speaking, megaprojects are gamechangers.  They’re a quest unto \nthemselves, and on completion, they give the tinker a massive edge, while becoming a \nquest or focus for others.  Examples of megaprojects include… \n \n●​ A gun turret mounted atop a skyscraper, shielded to prevent incoming ranged \nattacks and flying enemies.  The turret is capable of shooting anyone/anything in \nthe city. \n●​ A massive cannon with a target chosen at the time of its creation, capable of \nwiping a city off the map or taking a chunk out of the moon. \n●​ A bomb capable of nuking a city and nuking all electronics within a 2000 mile \nradius. \n●​ Skyscraper-sized mech. \n●​ A building that manufactures and produces an endless stream of humanoid \nrobots. \n \nWhile a different sort of megaproject, it could also include, say, a halberd that can \ndisintegrate anything struck. \n \nWhen creating megaprojects, a GM should outline five prerequisites.

They play in the session, and between sessions, he’ll give \nthem the opportunity to build, provided they have resources lined up.  Most of the \ntime, if they can’t build or don’t have anything they want to build, they’ll just \nresearch. \n \nAli has been saying that he’s researched everything he wants to use in the next \nwhile, and with this in mind, it comes as no surprise when the GM sends \nreminder emails about what the players want to build and research between \nsessions, and Ali says he’s interested in moving toward a megaproject.  Todd \ngives the A-ok, and they have a short back and forth about what this project will \nbe. \n \nAli already has something in mind and his thought process is as follows: his \ntinker is a resource tinker, utilizing raw material, usually crude electronics, and \nshe is an electricity tinker, so what if she made an engine that lets her turn \nelectricity into material, and material into electricity, over wide areas? \n \nGM Todd thinks this is fair, but has a few stipulations.  The produced matter is \ngoing to be ugly, crude, and noisy ‘junkyard’ style material much as the crude \nvoltage tinker’s stuff is, and the mechanics of the project is a specialized \ngenerator that’s hooked into the ‘grid’, allowing Ali to create the matter at will, at \nthe cost of blacking out the surrounding area, with the radius of the blackout \ndepending on the scale of the material created.  His reasoning is that this power \ndrain is a principle already established on the tinker sheet, and it provides a kind \nof counterplay - the generator has to be protected in a general sense, though it \ncan be hidden.  The tinker can’t affect any area with an isolated power grid.  \nTurning matter into storms of electricity operates by the same principle, but in \nreverse; more material consumed, bigger storm, and it takes time to exercise. \n \nAli checks that he could connect his special ‘grid’ to an isolated point with wires \nhe brings, and GM Todd agrees.

And for the third option, \ngiven that it’s a crude tinker and is special in that it does without fancy materials \nin favor of rough and ugly… \n \n●​ Use $50,000 in material, with raw, broken material being worth double.  \nCreation produces pollution (both noise and environmental) equivalent to \none modern city of 250,000 people.  Can take this option multiple times, \nbut each time it is taken, the cost in raw materials doubles and the amount \nof pollution doubles (exponentially).

In this case, the shard has more say, and the tinker tends to tune out, \nbuild aesthetically or find themselves unaware of the end result. \n \nThe tinker’s build options are very general - they decide one of the options on List A - \na general category, though they do not know the exact form that weapon will take, nor \nthe augment that is attached to it or the pattern that is connected.  A free augment is \nattached to all items, putting the Field Tester a step above other tinkers in general.  \nOn completion, one of these elements will be revealed to the tinker.  On testing \noutside of combat, another will be revealed.  On testing in the midst of a conflict, the \ntinker will get the complete sense of what their weapon or armor does.  In these \ncases, guns may not fire if a valid target isn’t identified, making it hard to identify if it’s \na lightning cannon or a railgun, as an example. \n \nFinally, the tinker gets to roll on the list of Tinker bonuses and augments, and any item \nthey build has a 12% chance to have a special feature, determined in secret - the \ntinker can attempt to uncover/activate a special feature, but being wrong means a \ngeneral, catastrophic misfire.  Attempting to trigger special feature in a serious \nconfrontation doubles the chance the special feature exists and never destroys the \nitem, nor will it directly harm the tinker. \nList A \nList B \nList C \nUnknown 1H gun \nUnknown 2H gun \nUnknown Melee \nUnknown Utility \nUnknown Drone \nUnknown Vehicle \nUnknown Suit/Armor \nUnknown Augment \nUnknown Pattern \n \n \nPatterns are drawn \nrandomly from one of three \ndifferent specialties. \nUnknown Concoction \nUnknown Grenade \nCharge trinket \nRepair trinket \nData trinket \nWorkstations \nDifficulties \nCannot research, cannot scan.

Removing augments also removes special features, plugging that \naugment into another item gives it the special feature, or a close analogue.  \nAccumulates a wide assortment of components over time - dismantled items need \nonly a tenth of the maintenance, making it easier to maintain a collection of options."

With just a nominal investment, the Golden Goose tinker can produce a \nmaterial station.  The station will thereafter produce one unit of material per day.  Use \nof these prefabricated parts and materials will make projects far faster and further \nreduce construction time and costs by 33% (multiplicative) while appending a positive, \ntypically noncombat quality (often improving reputation gain), with a maximum of one \nsuch quality per item.  The caveat, however, is that items are temporary, falling apart \neven with maintenance, which gets the tinker out of the workshop, and any time a \ncomponent takes damage, broken components are left on the battlefield, oft easily \nselling for fair sums (2d6 times $100).   \n \nIt is the seemingly inevitable fate (to the point it’s likely the shard’s design) of the \nGolden Goose tinker to find that others covet their material - and especially covet the \nsources of those materials.  Should others get their hands on them, material stations \nwork for a period of time (5% chance of breaking/day if not maintained) while churning \nout materials (double above value on open market) and provide 5x the value in \nmaterials if simply destroyed/looted on the spot.  If they sell their own materials, \nhowever, they oft find that inspiration stalls (100% chance they can’t build for 24 \nhours, 50% chance each day until tinker’s block is broken) and/or that unscrupulous \nindividuals start tracking them down and kicking in the door to their workshop. \n \nEach material station has either specialty or item type locked in (determined \nrandomly) and the other is random each time it produces something (ie. might \nproduce [Smoke] gun part, [Smoke] bodysuit part, or might produce [Smoke] gun part, \n[Fire] gun part]).

Trump powers are often the ones closest to the \nEntities’ means of operation and to the cycle, and are often assigned to more important, \ncarefully selected individuals.  As such, only about 1 in 24 to 1 in 36 powers are Trump powers \nin a noticeable, categorizable way. \n \nTrump triggers involve powers.  The person triggering need not know this - it matters to the \nshard.  The key points to pay attention to in such a trigger are the degree of ‘trumpness’, the \nassociated elements of the trigger, and finally, the relationship to the powers: how focused, \npositive, negative, or abstract they might be. \n \nIn terms of ‘trumpness’, take note of how close the relationship is between the triggeree’s shard \nand the other shards that it ‘pings’.  Proximity and degrees of separation matter here.  Being \nface to face with a threatening cape would be the most direct relationship in both proximity and \nseparation, while a tinker drone might be a serious degree of separation, with proximity varying.  \nA fire created by a pyrokinetic that has since left the scene or ceased uffecting said flames \nwould be very low in both categories, to the point that it might have very little ‘trumpness’, even \nto the point of not being recognizable as a trump classification.   \n \nThe other elements of the trigger go hand in hand with ‘trumpness’.  Any trump trigger will also \nmatch one of the other eleven classifications in terms of what kind of powers it might give.  This \ncan serve as a vector for the trump power to be expressed.  If a power has low trumpness and \nfits the Mover trigger requisites, then it will be a Mover power with perhaps a note or touch of \nflavor as a nod to the trump classification, such as the ability to shrug off powers while moving \nfull speed.  If that trigger has a high trump fixation, then the power might well be a trump power \nwith the mover power being a vector or complimentary factor.

I.e. what Circus \ntriggered, did the firebreating shard say to the hammerspace shard \"yo, we should team up \nfor this one\", so that both shards maintain the same parahuman? \n2. Do multitriggers have to be from the same sort of trauma? Can someone get hit by a car and \nget a \"brute\" trigger, while another wants to avoid police scrutiny and gets a \"stranger\" \ntrigger, but this count as a multitrigger so that they both get a brutey-strangery power? \n3. Specifically, could a tinker trigger (with the long term stress implied) be a multitrigger? A to-\nbe-tinker stresses too much during test, while a to-be-stranger who didn't prepare for the \ntest gets caught cheating, resulting in a strange-tinker (is there any other kind?)? \n4. What would Circus's hammer space be classified as? \n5. Would Dauntless be classified as a tinker? \n6. Cape families can spread \"down\" the family tree, but not up - i.e. the son of a cape is more \nlikely to be a cape, but not the father of a cape. (I read it somewhere in Worm - I think I did \nanyway). Is this just because of the age restriction? Can older siblings of a cape be 'second-\ngen'? \n7. For the purpose of determining the power, is the application or the technicality of the power \nmore important? I.e. Dragon is classified as a tinker, but is technically a thinker (who \nunderstands tinker tech) - so should she have a tinker trigger because of the use of her \npower? Do the shards 'model' the implications of a power before granting them? \n \nОтвет: \n \n1. Powers from multitriggers are from a mix of shards. The shards, instead of going all-in, give \nup a small to moderate portion of themselves, and then leave the rest of themselves to \ndevelop normally while taking in info from multiple sources, just like a shard would naturally \ngather info and eventually reach the point where it could bud. Except in this case, the shard \nwill usually just go find another host, maybe with relation to one of the multi's, maybe not, \nand empower them. \n2. There would need to be some common ground. It's very possible that, in a car accident \nwhere two individuals triggered, that one would get seriously hurt and be anxious about 'oh \nfuck, my life is ruined, what do I do!?\", While the other is like \"Oh fuck! I'm going to jail!\" \nwhile being a little bruised. The former gets a major brute power with minor thinker, while \nthe latter gets a minor brute power with a major thinker. And the shards want to keep them \ninvolved and interacting, so in pretty short order they start to really hate or really like each \nother. \n3. See Archival in Lausanne. Reading the session isn't needed, but you can read the intro for \nhow this plays out. \n4. Stranger \n5. No. \n6. Not age restriction. The shards prefer younger people because they're generally going to last \na little longer if they wind up finding some degree of success (by virtue of being younger), \nbecause they have faster reflexes, there's more room for breadth and depth to develop (see \nBonesaw, Jack, Number Man), and because they're more emotionally volatile or face more \ndramatic situations in the day to day than your typical adult does (Taylor vs. Danny). \n7. Dragon would be a tinker on the PRT books, but in execution she's very thinker. Her trigger is \nmore thinkery. Shards do some modeling, but sometimes low-end powers just get scattered \nout to generally relevant targets. You really don't need to think too hard about how that"

Some sections may have more \ninformation than others. \nVery Brief and Possibly Inaccurate Classification Overview \n \nMover Has a power enhancing mobility. \nPeople who trigger as movers tend to have something they’re trying to escape from whether thats: \nphysical pain, mental harm, emotional harm, mounting pressure, insurmountable obstacles, or an \naccumulation of small abuses/hassles. \n \nShaker Has a power with an area of effect. \nThose who trigger as Shakers tend to be threatened by some kind of environmental or ambient \ndanger, often non-human in nature. \n \nBrute Has enhanced strength or durability. \nThose who trigger as Brutes tend to have been harmed through physical sources, energy-based \nsources, or misc damage (which includes such things as poison, disease, genetic issues, etc). \n \nBreaker Can shift into another state. \nThose who trigger as Breakers tend to have their trigger events have an physical and mental element \nthat are indivisibly linked.

Examples include: Crushing revelations, \nmoments of mental or emotional anguish, great fear, anger, and self-loathing. \n \nStriker Has a power that is melee-ranged or touch-based. \nThose who trigger as Strikers tend to have a singular, immediate threat in close proximity at the \nmoment of the trigger. \n \nChanger Can alter their form or appearance. \nThose who trigger as Changers tend to have and emotional issues involving identity or body image, \nor from conflicts involving constraining social expectations \n \nTrump Can manipulate powers in some capacity. \nThose who trigger as Trumps will have trigger events similar to any other category, with the \nexception that the events will involve powers. The attitude and proximity to the power that helped \ncause the trigger will affect the resulting Trump ability, as positive attitudes tend to result in more \ngiving abilities while negative attitudes tend to bestow stealing abilities. \n \nStranger Focuses on stealth or infiltration. \nThose who trigger as Strangers tend to have a threat to emotional and mental security or social or \ncollective pressure, often with a focus on unwanted attention. \nGiven the brief overview, and our focus on our character’s ruined, poisoned body and his current \nhopelessness, the classifications that come to mind are Brute and Thinker, so we’ll focus on those. \nOnce again, other categories may apply and changing when the character triggers can also put \nemphasis on some categories than others."

          "text": "You're a young athlete who's finally made it. You're at the Olympics. This is what you've wanted your \nwhole life. It's the night of the opening ceremonies and, after some crazy partying, and more booze \nthan you knew was possible, you get on your motorbike and head back to the village. You don't \nremember much after that, some bright flashes, a loud crashing noise, and darkness. You wake up in \na hospital bed. You can't feel your legs and your arms aren't listening to you. You start to panic and a \nnurse comes over to help. She tells you that you drifted off the road and crashed. She says it's \nmiraculous that you're even alive, but that you broke your neck. You're a quadriplegic now, so not \nonly will you never walk again, but someone will have to help you piss. Trigger. \n \nWildbow: \n \nBreaking it down... \nThemes: strength, success, party, the crash- in more than one sense. A fall to reality, a hobbling or \ncrippling. Panic, and a looming future of dependency. \nClassifications: I personally like changer for this, due to the emphasis on that looming future of \ndependency and how the trigger paints a journey from success, rising up, to something else. \"This is \nnot who I'm supposed to be\" is Changer. For other classifications that could inform it pain is brute \nand the mind/body disconnect is breaker. \nIt'd be neat to mirror that rise and fall, to sort of tie things into that panic and the scattered, dim \nmemory of partying and whooping, wild activity. With this in mind, I like framing the changer power \nas something they can build up. They can gather & layer on lean muscle like Bitch builds up her \ndogs, but it's relatively fast if they want it. Once they reach peak size, however, they overload. They \ngo from being at double or quadruple normal strength, to getting one or two actions where they're \nalmost world class in terms of their combined strength & agility (even among capes), and the \nchanger augmentation then falls away. They then feel pain, restlessness and debilitation to degrees \nmultiplied by how long they drew it out, between power onset and hitting that peak, and if they \npushed themselves (going for that second big super-strength move at their world-class peak level, \nwhere I said 'one or two', for example). \nFor changer forms, I sort of think back to the party animal, the whooping, the wild activity and \nmessing around, and the human side of things, what they were hoping to be, in a way - tie the two \ntogether (and call back to the Brute element noted in classifications above) and we veer into the \nterritory of the primate. We've seen gorillas before (Grodd, Winston) but we can go in that direction \nwithout mirroring it exactly (baboon, oversized chimp, or just reminiscent of the primate without \n100% mirroring any given one). Shifted proportions (longer arms), muscle, teeth, feet that can grip \nthings, leaping/lunging power, throwing power, etc. \nSo here's the deal/dilemma inherent in the power: Yes, they can use it to work around their disability. \nThey can activate their power and layer on external muscle as a kind of external frame, and they're \nfunctional - they can feed themselves and go for walks, and spend time with their girlfriend, so long \nas they're just mindfully ticking up their degree of mutation. From 5% to 5.5% to 6%... if they don't \npay that mindful attention then it'll go ahead on its own, cruising up toward peak. And getting a \nhalf-day or full day of being almost themselves (albeit a little lumpier) comes at a cost of time spent \nparalyzed, groaning in pain with teeth grit and spittle frothing at the corners of their mouth. \nOrrr, they can temper the bad periods with hard drugs, dope themselves up to cut down on the pain \nand sleep through the convalescence/cooldown periods. The interesting part of this is that it'd \nprobably lead to bad places or hanging out with worse people. Really, to minimize pain and any slips \ndown dark roads, he should remain quadriplegic and only use his power when it calls for it, doing"

Let's go \nwith thinker, dabbling in resources to some extent (see themes) to get tinker-lite. \n(Were I to go tinker, it'd probably be a resource tinker; special materials & a leaning toward one-shot \nbuilds aimed at single tasks, for the leap of faith) \nThey're a precog, in a way, but in a way that doesn't actively use their senses or mind as a lens for \nthat precognition. They make things, and these things aren't tinkerings, but they do have a kind of \nalien hand with external knowledge guiding them. They want to complete a task and they'll fashion \ntools in the course of preparing for that task. There might be a pattern or aesthetic running through \nit, depending on who they are or what they end up doing, but the effect is much the same. Gear and \nstuff they prepare is well made and has a way of working just right, at just the right moments. If he \ncrosses swords with Chevalier, his own blade might shatter, but a shard is liable to shatter and fly \nthrough the slot of Chevalier's visor, catching the hero in the eye. Smoke from bombs he's made has \na way of not bothering him, not hampering his senses in the same way, because the custom truck \nmade a certain shape and size of hole in the wall and the air currents are keeping the worst of the \nsmoke away from his eyes, while allowing that smoke to still mask his position. When that same \ncustom truck explodes, 5 minutes into the heroes' intervention into the robbery, it's timed such that \nhe gets out okay. \nHe is, given preparation and the resources/tools of his own devising, something of a force of nature, \nprobably just as surprised as anyone when things turn out as they do, but he can roll with it, \nespecially as he uses tools and resources that maximize damage dealt and maximize the randomness \nand chaos. That homebrewed pipe bomb filled with a random assortment of nails and shrapnel isn't \ngoing to send anything his way, or at any of the mooks he hired with the money from the last job... \nnot unless that mook was aiming to betray him and screw up the job. \nIt plays into the leaps of faith and the anxiety, and leaves him pretty flexible in terms of what he \nmight want to do or how he does it. He could be active and involved, trying to gather funds, or he \ncould try to play the chessmaster; one who runs things and only really gets involved to join a job and \nensure it goes right."

Nothing really points to sudden \nchange, one driven by the need to escape, resources, or anything like that. I'm leaning heavily toward \na gradual change & influence, to match the gradual realization of their Self. Kind of creates a \nscenario where, in the sudden, odious moments where the threat looms (dad appearing in their \nroom), they don't have access to their full capabilities, and are forced to be a bit of a scrapper. \nI'm picturing, just to touch on the latent themes of religion and the natural/unnatural, extensions \nresembling wings (akin to an angel's) with branches framing them (picture a wing with 'claws' of \nwood at the outer boundaries, for example), or branches (for the natural) with leaves at the ends; the \nleaves/feathers being something hard to pin down as one or the other, as would be the difference \nbetween a wing & a branch. \nThese extensions fan out from forearms, upper arms, back, legs, as antlers/horns/a mane, etc. \nPersonal body weight drops steeply with each such manifestation - at full extension/growth, a single \nsweep of an arm/wing/bough will produce enough push to buoy them into the air. Acrobatics are \npossible. Bough/wings are capable of taking a surprising amount of damage, if used to parry an \nincoming attack. Cannot fly, but could glide. \nMore to the point, however, each strike delivered/received is liable to shake the feather-leaves and \nassociated dust free, scattering it into the environment. This dust and these feathers impose a \npermanent alteration to the mental & emotional state (and mental/emotional underpinnings) of \nthose affected (with vastly more effect if used to deliver a blow to someone's face), varying \ndepending on use. Face-coverings and sealed outfits vastly reduce the effect. Liable to be \nuncontrolled at first; fixating on dad's anger might lead to the dust/feathers making \nhim permanently angry, while a desire to mitigate or placate the situation might influence the result \nto do the opposite - permanently stripping away dad's ability to get angry or offended. May gain \nsome control over the effect, but only after sufficient practice and exploration of the aftereffects."

Now, a lot of relationship issues and master-ish powers tend to involve time, so this \nis an easy trap to fall into. I would recommend keeping that in your back pocket if you're really \nstalled in creation. For now, let's go forward with Master. \nPhase one of a good power creation is to dig for themes and elements. Pull out words and elements \nyou can keep in mind as you work on other stuff. We can pull out rejection, denial (both in being \ndenied and in her acting like it didn't happen), and the chaos or surprise of the party (onlookers, \nbabble, music) coinciding with the moment of that messy kiss and the random person.

The groups \nand swarms are out. That leaves single minion masters, puppeteers, duplicators, emotion powers, \ninfluencers, and direct control. Self duplication feels too self-absorbed when the girl is the focus. \nScratch that. \n \nSingle Minion masters might trigger from the loss of a someone, typically through death. The \ndeath of a spouse, a child losing their personality and mind to a degenerative condition. \n \nPuppeteer masters might trigger from a break or change in a relationship leading to a \ncompromise of the self, or a loss of someone through a loss of control, circumstances, or \nevents.

There's actual short term physical \nharm, with touch being the most intense, movement second most intense, and seeing being least. \nTouching a 'no touch' zone that was applied with touch is enough to make people bleed or the skin \nburn to the point of blistering. He can't control the actual type of harm, and the severity of it can \nvary. \nHe can, with concentration, either intensify an effect he already laid out, or he can focus his will on a \nperson.

          "text": "Breakers are those who alter their physical (and sometimes mental) state to something alien and \npower-generated. While all powers have some small element of breaker to them, the breaker-centric \npowers are the ones where the individual switches over to a completely different state. The state can \nhave a singular benefit that breaks the defined rules of reality (as any power does, but centered \naround the parahuman's capabilities) or a state they enter that contains a suite of powers, but that \nstate may have costs when adopting it, costs to maintain it, or costs and complications in other \nforms. \n \nBreaker triggers are perhaps the hardest to define lay out in clear terms. Breakers sometimes come \nfrom abstract stressors or those things that are the very odd fits for other classifications. For a mover, \nthis might include things like wanting to escape on a physical level while mentally feeling that the \nsituation is safe, the inverse, or something more abstract, like wanting to escape reality on a spiritual \nlevel and finding oneself unable, or wanting to escape a concept or wanting to escape something \nthat cannot be avoided on a fundamental level. Other Breakers arise from cases where the lines are \nso blurred and/or intermingled between the physical and the mental that usual classifications don't \nneatly fit. Drugs, poisons, medical conditions and mental illness very frequently create the unusual \nscenarios that make Breaker triggers possible. \n \nThe trick, and where things get hard to discern, is that it can be hard to say if the trigger is a breaker \ntrigger that has (as an example) Striker and Changer interlinked in one element, or if A and B are \nsimply separate factors of the same trigger. The former might lead to a breaker with elements of \nStriker and Changer, while the latter might lead to a cape with a Striker primary power and a \nChanger secondary, or vice versa. With this in mind, key questions to ask are: \n \n \n \nCould the elements feeding into one aspect of the trigger be removed, with the trigger event \nstill making some degree of sense? In the above hypothetical, could you remove the parts \nthat make it a changer trigger and leave it as striker only, with a rewrite? If the combination \nof the two are so interlinked as to be irreconcilable, it could be a breaker trigger. \n \n \nIs it a trigger classification that is normally mental being expressed in a very physical way, or \nvice versa? \n \n \nAre drugs, poisons, disease, other medical conditions or mental conditions at play? If so, that \nmight create the conditional factor that makes it more 'Breaker'. \n \n \nDoes, for lack of a better way of putting it, the trigger sit on the outside bounds of the usual \n'box' that the classification fits in? Strikers trigger from in-your-face hostile threats. Is the \nthreat hard to define or explain, either in the character's perceptions or in reality? Changers \ntrigger from identity issues and cases where the outside world impugns the character's set \nidentity. Is that identity crisis hard to define or explain, even for the individual in question? \nSimilar questions can be asked for other classifications. Is the damage a Brute takes hard to \nexplain or frame? Is the long-term problem a tinker faces hard to outline in terms of being \nlong-term or a problem? \nMover Breakers: \n \n \n \nA deep sea diver ascends too fast, and gets the bends.

Whatever her reasons, she isn't \nisolated, and is instead subsumed by an environment that welcomes her, accepts her, and \nsurrounds her with smiling faces, yet still somehow leaves her lost and disconnected. Yes, it's \na bit changer, but the anti-isolation isolation trigger is wobbly enough to lead to heads being \nscratched, potentially. \nTinker Breaker: \n \n \n \nNot very common. Perhaps a scenario where a twenty-something spends a decade without \nany meaningful problems to solve, so the lack of problems becomes a problem, which leads \nto a kind of cyclical issue. \nBlaster Breakers"

          "text": "The question is essentially, 'What part of the Trump's trigger event determines the nuances of the \nresulting power?' \n \nIn short, what was the relationship to powers at the time of the trigger event? \n \nOthala's power grants powers. It does so by means of a striker venue (touch) and it's \na positive relationship. She was being supported by a variety of powers when she triggered due to a \npointed and immediate, in-her-face physical threat. The clan was attacked, possibly during a moot, a \nbig meeting of multiple branches of the family/organization. Someone came after her, and despite \neverything, all the power around her, fighting off the other enemies, this guy wasn't stopped. He had \na weapon or grabbed her and scared her. Good enough for a second generation trigger. I imagine \nthat after that point, during the usual 'trigger visions' blackout, that someone (an unpowered Victor?) \nknocked out the assailant. \n \nUsher - Consistent trump effect (one parahuman?), focused to the point of applying to one preson, \n(threat to one individual), ranged application (blaster-esque situation?), protective (harm involved?). \nThe trump effect blocks powers, implying that the relationship to the power at the time of the trigger \nis direct and negative. I'm picturing Usher being lifted by TK and dragged toward some threat \n(building's edge? churning machinery?) with the telekinetic further back, advancing. It fulfills the \ntrend for gaining powers to have ironic consequences if he inadvertently cancels the other \nparahuman's powers while being threatened and held over a large drop, and that the resulting \npower reshapes his life to fling him again and again into confrontations vs. parahumans like the one \nthat nearly killed him. \n \nGalvanate grants invincibility, a brute effect, and an electric touch. Not so different from Usher; we \ncan note that the power granted is consistent (one threat), but isn't a direct response/counter to the \npower (ie. isn't nullification/power resistance, so the triggeree isn't directly being affected by \npowers). It's possible that the enemy was a parahuman actively using their powers, but the \ntrigger/threat was more indirect, and the threat was to multiple individuals (can grant power to many \npeople). The involvement of electricity suggests a theme or context element. Machinery, perhaps? I \npicture a mob enforcer and his people fighting an enemy from another group, who is bombarding \nan area with incendiary shells and missiles. A tinker in a mech suit, firing off an endless barrage. \nGalvanate's group, his men, friends, maybe family, are all in danger as fire spreads and sections of \nbuilding start to come down. Trigger. \n \nGrue is a power stealer. Powers are available from supporting allies and opposition. The threat is \nrelatively abstract/hard to define, and he mimics the elements of his original trigger event, so this \nbecomes the vector for his power."

          "text": "Green/'Type Three' trumps steal, copy, or borrow powers. The trigger involves a mental or emotional \nrelationship to powers. More negative? More of a steal. Middle ground? Borrow. More positive? \nCopy. Obviously stealing has its advantages (implying the person you take it from has no power or \nless power while you have it - usually isn't permanent but is inconvenient. Here, you've got the \naddict who is addicted to the powers someone grants (a la Teacher), the person who saw someone \ntrigger and pursues them from scene to scene, collecting the debris with flickers of power on it, a \ncollector of tinker gear has their collection confiscated. \nI think the example you've listed is a little mundane - there's no twist or gimmick to it, so it doesn't \nfeel especially Wormy. Part of the problem is you started from the power and now you're working \nbackward, when it should be the other way around. \nConsider a power thief who needs to eat a piece of their opponent to steal the power. \nThe power thief who steals a power but ends up in a tug of war with the person they stole from - \nusing a power more means you have more power and they have less. and the same goes for them - \nso you're both using powers as much as possible to get control of the power, sacrificing sleep, being \nreckless, etc. Picture the kind of trigger or relationship with powers that might lead to someone \ngetting that kind of power. \nThere are thieves and copiers who look for specific kinds of power. Spright copies mover powers. \nUpperhand copies powers, but modifies them so they have a 'high gravity' effect instead of fire, ice, \nglass, or blood (such a copy power generally doesn't get much from powers that it can't easily copy- \nso a thinker power isn't so useful). \nThink about what happens to the victim when they're copied or stolen from. How does it work? You \ncould toy with that. Imagine that you stole a power, and you weakened the target's power by 20%, \nand afterward you & the target both had 80% of the power. What if they gain 24/7 knowledge of \nyou and where you are, while you have their power? How neat would that be? How the heck do you \nuse that, eh?"

On one \nlevel, losing someone very important to you is going to feed into having a singular minion, often \nwith an identity, vs. losing connections to the scattered world and having ~everyone~ turn their \nbacks on you, where your minions might be very numerous & scattered and might change from \nencounter to encounter (incidentally or as an extension of the power) \nBut that's just one of the sliding scales. The other is sorta rooted in other classifications. Does the \nisolation tie back into mover? Brute? Tinker? With projection/extrusion characters you're really \ngetting them from scenarios where there's more of a breaker/changer (and it's muddy) root to the \npower. \nWith influence in body or emotion it's very much a stranger/master blend. \nThe person/not person thing is tied into element, for lack of a better word - it's a general term I keep \ngoing back to, but theme, the underlying personality, the actual nature of the minion being very \ndependent on the person going through the event. Strip away everything in the event and just keep \nthe bare bones bullet points, put a different person there with a different context, and you get \ndifferent minions. \n \nForgery - Yesterday at 4:11 PM \nThat's fascinating, thanks for all the information \n \nWildbow - Yesterday at 4:13 PM \nContrast, say, desperation, feeling small, feeling nauseated and helpless and being defined by all of \nthe little tools and coping mechanisms you've been accumulating vs., say, being a scrapper, fighting \nthe good fight, being surrounded by kin, being angry, being cornered and biting. These two different \npeople with the same shard get very different results. \n \nForgery - Yesterday at 4:14 PM \nSo its just as much dependent on the person as on the actual trigger for master powers, gotcha. \n \nWildbow - Yesterday at 4:15 PM \nFor a blaster, it helps inform the element you're shooting - whether it's fire or cold, for example. For \nTinker, it'd be specialization. Flavor is very much a reflection of the person and context."
